  "content": "<h1>Transforming Health through Hydration</h1>\n<p>In the heart of Mirpur, school children have long struggled with water-borne illnesses. Last month, our team completed the installation of UV-filtration systems across three primary schools.</p>\n\n<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n<p>Before this intervention, over 30% of students reported absences due to stomach infections. Clean drinking water was a luxury that many families could not afford at home, leading to a cycle of illness and missed education.</p>\n\n<h3>Our Impact</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>1,200+ Students</strong> now have daily access to safe water.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reduction in illness:</strong> Preliminary data shows a 40% drop in water-related clinic visits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We have trained local staff to maintain the UV-filters weekly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\"Since the filters were installed, my daughter hasn't missed a single day of school. She feels stronger and more focused.\" — <em>Rahima, Local Parent</em></blockquote>\n\n<p>This project was made possible by our monthly donors. Together, we are ensuring that no child has to choose between their health and their education.</p>",
